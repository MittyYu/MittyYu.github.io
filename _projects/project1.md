### Project Overview
This project involved creating a sophisticated warehouse simulation model using **AnyLogic**. The primary goal was to provide a data-driven tool for optimizing warehouse operations and forecasting future resource requirements.

### Key Features
*   **Digital Twin:** The model functions as a digital twin of the physical warehouse.
*   **Data-Driven Decisions:** Enables decision-making based on simulated performance metrics.
*   **Resource Planning:** Helps predict future needs for staffing, equipment, and space.

### Technologies Used
Here is a snippet of the kind of logic involved:
```java
// Example of a custom agent function in AnyLogic
if (pallet.isReadyForShipping()) {
    send(pallet, outboundTruck);
}
```

You can find more details in the [official AnyLogic documentation](https://www.anylogic.com/).
