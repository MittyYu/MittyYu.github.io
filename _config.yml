# Base URL for the site.
# This is crucial for GitHub Pages. It works with Jekyll's 'relative_url' filter.
# IMPORTANT: For your MittyYu.github.io repository (which is a User/Organization Page),
# the baseurl should be an empty string. This tells Jekyll your site is at the root of the domain.
# If this were a project page (e.g., MittyYu.github.io/my-project/), you'd put baseurl: "/my-project"
baseurl: ""

# Permalink structure for blog posts
# This defines how your blog post URLs will look.
# Options:
#   /:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title.html  (Jekyll's default, very long)
#   /blog/:year/:month/:day/:title.html         (Common, organized by date)
#   /blog/:title/                               (Cleanest for SEO and readability, highly recommended)
permalink: /blog/:title/

# Default front matter for content
# This is a great time-saver! It automatically applies certain front matter
# variables to files within specified scopes.
defaults:
  - scope:
      path: "_posts" # Applies to all Markdown files in the _posts directory
    values:
      layout: post # Automatically sets 'layout: post' for every blog post

plugins:
  - jekyll-archives # Make sure this line is present and not commented out

jekyll-archives:
  enabled: []
  layout: archive
  permalinks:
    year: '/:year/'
    month: '/:year/:month/'
    day: '/:year/:month/:day/'
    tag: '/tag/:name/'
    category: '/category/:name/'
