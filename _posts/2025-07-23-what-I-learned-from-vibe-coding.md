Hi, I'm Mitty and welcome to my blog.

First of all, I never really had any experience in web dev, app dev, system design, and backend. All I had was some knowledge that I barely still remember from CS40 at Stanford, experience using google cloud for AI stuff, and some basic coding skills that I gained overtime. App development is something that I have never really learned about, but have a lot of passion and wanted to start building something.

So, I started my pet groomer app dev project. It all started when I stumbled upon a medium post about Microniche SaaS Ideas, where the author specifically mentioned that mobile groomer spent 15 hours per month on manual scheduling. This is when I started framing the question, understanding the need, designing the system, and dived into the code.
