## Bridging Engineering Strategy and Data Innovation

My professional identity sits at a fascinating intersection: I'm an **Industrial Engineer** with a powerful knack for **software development and data science**. You could say I'm an IE with a coding superpower, constantly seeking to optimize, innovate, and solve complex problems from a fresh, data-driven perspective.

## My Journey So Far

My path began in **Taiwan**, where an early curiosity for robotics quickly evolved into a fascination with coding and its potential. This led me to **National Tsing Hua University**, where I intentionally merged Industrial Engineering with a Computer Science minor. There, I discovered immense satisfaction in leveraging code to tackle traditional IE challenges, particularly in data analysis and decision-making within the manufacturing space.

Driven by a desire to deepen my expertise, I then journeyed to **Stanford University's Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME)**. This program allowed me to immerse myself in the mathematical foundations and practical applications of applied data science, sharpening my analytical and development skills considerably.

Today, I'm an Industrial engineer at **Applied Materials**, where I bring this unique blend of operational foresight and technical execution to life. My work involves driving innovation in warehouse operations â€“ from developing sophisticated digital twin simulations to implementing computer vision solutions that deliver tangible efficiency gains. It's incredibly rewarding to see the real-world impact of data and algorithms.


## Beyond the Algorithms

While my professional life revolves around data and engineering, my curiosity doesn't stop there. In my free time, you'll often find me:


* **Discovering new tech:** Exploring the latest tools and trends, like GPTs, MCP, and AI agents.
* **Developing small passion projects:** Bringing ideas to life is one of my favorite things to do! I love seeing my small ideas become a reality.
* **Enjoying art:** Finding inspiration and perspective in various creative expressions.
* And, most importantly, **figuring out my life:** A continuous journey of learning and self-discovery.
